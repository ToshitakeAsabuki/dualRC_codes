These codes are written in python3, and dependent on numpy, scipy and matplotlib.
They include

* single.py : Training neural network for learning single chunk.
* multi.py : Training neural network for learning multiple chunk.
* overlapped.py : Training neural network for learning chunks with overlaps.
* tcs.py : Training neural network for learning temporal community structure of sequence.

Running these codes will reproduce the main results in the publication :  Asabuki, T.,  Hiratani, N., & Fukai, T. (2018). Interactive reservoir computing for chunking information streams. PLoS Computational Biology.
